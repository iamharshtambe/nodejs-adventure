# Node.js Adventure

A structured journey through the foundations and core concepts of Node.js, covering essential topics such as modularization, file system operations, the event loop, thread pool, streams, and server creation.

## Structure of Repository

### 01-introduction

Here, I learned about the simple **node** program and the **global object** in Node.js.

### 02-modularization

Explored **module.exports** and **require** to understand how to structure code using modules in Node.js.

### 03-fs

Learned about the **File System (fs) module** and how to perform file operations in Node.js.

### 04-event-loop

Understood the **event loop** mechanism and how Node.js handles asynchronous operations efficiently.

### 05-thread-pool

Explored the **thread pool** and how Node.js manages background tasks with worker threads.

### 06-streams-buffers

Learned about **streams and buffers** in Node.js for handling large amounts of data efficiently.

### 07-server

Created a **simple server** using Node.js to understand the basics of backend development.

## How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Navigate to the desired folder in the terminal.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   node <filename>.js
   ```
